# Roam

I love testing out different CSS templates for Roam Research. Recently, I found the Neon-80s template for Obsidian note taker and have been trying to emulate the look in Roam. Feel free to edit the code and add your inputs so we can achieve the look. 

- I am a novice at CSS

This is the link to the Obsidian theme to take inspiration from https://github.com/siddchauhan77/80s-Neon-for-Obsidian.md
